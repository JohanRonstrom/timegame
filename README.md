# Timegame

I'm doing a point-and-click adventure game in React!

I have had this game concept in mind for a long time now, and I want to learn React, so here we go.

## Story Concept

The concept is that a child is thrown back in time to different eras. By learning the ways of that era and using modern skills and knowledge to solve puzzles, you work your way back to your own time.

Eras might include:

- Stone age
- Bronze/iron age
- Medieval
- Renaissance
- Vicorian
- Late 1900s

## Game Systems

Notably, the game will not include a moving character. It will instead be more similar to Nancy Drew or Shadowgate. This mostly to not get stuck implementing pathing and such.

Instead I want to focus on good puzzles, solid UX and well structured code.

## Random Ideas

Perhaps some items have been brought from "the future"... Photos of modern things that can be used to understand things or hint at solutions (row boat, suspension bridge, water mill, art), a scout handbook with spieces of flora and fauna and handy survival tips...
